To build this documentation you need:
	DIA 		- opensource tool for diagram generation to process *.dia files into *.png
	LaTex		- latex distribution to process *.tex file into *.pdf
	gnuplot		- opensource tools for plotting data to process *.plt and *.dat files into *.png
	make		- make system
	
To build this this documentation all you need to do is enter directory and execute ``make``

To add new DIA diagram just paste your diagram in *.dia format into documentation directory.
To add new plot create new *.dat file containing plot data and *.plt file with same name as *.dat file containing plot settings.
All *.tex files are UTF-8 encoded.
